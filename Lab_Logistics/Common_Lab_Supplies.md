http://www.omega.com/pptst/OB_BOND_CHEM_SET.html

CC Filler ($36.00)  CC high temperature cement powder
CC Binder ($36.00)  CC high temperature cement liquid

*Rationale:*
This nonmagnetic cement mixture is necessary to repair broken paleomagnetic samples which are undergoing analysis.

#### Quartz Polished Discs for sample mounting and rockmag

Item # 7500-01, Quartz Polished Discs 1" x 1/16"
http://gmassoc.thomasnet.com/item/quartz-discs-2/quartz-polished-discs/7500-01?
They are $3.75 each

*Rationale:*
We will mount <1" diameter samples on these quartz disks which are otherwise too small for our magnetometer's 1" sample holder.  This way, we can run necessary rock magnetic characterization experiments on small samples which are essential for achieving the goals of the project associated with this fund.
