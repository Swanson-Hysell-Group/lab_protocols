### Ordering supplies for the lab

Go to: https://bearbuy.is.berkeley.edu/ and log-in. Some items can be found through one of the vendors on the site. If what needs to be ordered is a "Non-catalog item," click Non-Catalog Form under Frequently used forms and fill out the information. Once a cart has been created, some addition info needs to be entered. Click cart details and enter the "Org Node" of the department which is PGEGE. If you know the accounting code, enter it. If not, leave it blank. Under comments, enter the rationale for the order and its benefit to the project (this is required by the university if NSF funds are being used for the purchase). Make sure that the shipping info is filled out and then assign the cart to Nick Swanson-Hysell who can approve and submit to university purchasing.

### Swanson-Hysell Lab Common Lab Supplies

http://www.omega.com/pptst/OB_BOND_CHEM_SET.html

CC Filler ($36.00)  CC high temperature cement powder
CC Binder ($36.00)  CC high temperature cement liquid

*Rationale:*
This cement mixture is necessary to repair broken paleomagnetic samples which are undergoing analysis.

#### Lead screw lubricant
Thomson TriGel 300S
https://www.thomsonlinear.com/en/product/TRIGEL-300S

*Rationale:*
This lead screw lubricant is required to lubricate the threaded rails that position the tray on the magnetometer.

#### Sodium silicate solution 

*Rationale:*
This sodium silicate solution works as a non-magnetic glue for attaching broken paleomagnetic cores. 


#### Quartz Polished Discs for sample mounting and rockmag

Item # 7500-01, Quartz Polished Discs 1" x 1/16"
http://gmassoc.thomasnet.com/item/quartz-discs-2/quartz-polished-discs/7500-01?
They are $3.75 each

*Rationale:*
We will mount <1" diameter samples on these quartz disks which are otherwise too small for our magnetometer's 1" sample holder.  This way, we can run necessary rock magnetic characterization experiments on small samples which are essential for achieving the goals of the project associated with this fund.

#### GLASS SAMPLE RODS
