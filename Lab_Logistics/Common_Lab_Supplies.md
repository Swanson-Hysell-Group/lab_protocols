### Ordering supplies for the lab

Go to: https://bearbuy.is.berkeley.edu/ and log-in. Some items can be found through one of the vendors on the site. If what needs to be ordered is a "Non-catalog item," click Non-Catalog Form under Frequently used forms and fill out the information. Once a cart has been created, some addition info needs to be entered. Click cart details and enter the "Org Node" of the department which is PGEGE. If you know the accounting code, enter it. If not, leave it blank. Under comments, enter the rationale for the order and its benefit to the project (this is required by the university if NSF funds are being used for the purchase). Make sure that the shipping info is filled out and then assign the cart to Nick Swanson-Hysell who can approve and submit to university purchasing.

#### Magnetometer sample changer stage

acetal block that ride along threaded screws: https://www.mcmaster.com/84845K126/

Precision Acme Lead Screws that needs to be machined to fit the size of the stage. The ends of the screws also needs to be machined so that it can fit bronze washers and plastic bearings: https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/129/1365/98980A370

You will also need to buy an Acme thread tap to finish the blocks: https://www.mcmaster.com/taps/thread-size~1-2-10/

#### Magnetometer roller chain

FRA-10FT PIC design No-slip positioning belt: https://www.pic-designcatalog.com/fra-10ft.html

Alternative: 14CCF-10FT_FLEX-E-PITCH BELT from WINFRED M. BERG: https://www.wmberg.com/products/belts-and-chains/flex-e-pitch/1/14ccf-10ft?pcomSession=OK

#### High-temperature cement

http://www.omega.com/pptst/OB_BOND_CHEM_SET.html

CC Filler ($36.00)  CC high temperature cement powder
CC Binder ($36.00)  CC high temperature cement liquid

*Rationale:*
This cement mixture is necessary to repair broken paleomagnetic samples which are undergoing analysis.

#### Lead screw lubricant
Thomson TriGel 300S
https://www.thomsonlinear.com/en/product/TRIGEL-300S

*Rationale:*
This lead screw lubricant is required to lubricate the threaded rails that position the tray on the magnetometer.

** update from Yiming 1/19/2022: regular Super Lube brand synthetic lubricant grease works better than the LedScrew lubricant - it dries much slower and is much cheaper than the led screw lubricant.

#### Sodium silicate solution 

J.T. Baker Sodium silicate solution which is available through Fisher Scientific on BearBuy (Sodium Silicate Solution CAS Number: 1344-09-8, 500mL, 3877-01 1/EA)
Part Number	02004231;
Manufacturer Info	3877-01 - (J.t.baker);
CAS Number	1344-09-8

*Rationale:*
This sodium silicate solution works as a non-magnetic glue for attaching broken paleomagnetic cores. 

** update from Yiming 1/19/2022: the Baker brand sodium silicate solution is thick and makes solid cement less likely to puff up bubbles after high-temperature heatings. But regular cheap 40% sodium silicate solutions also works. The trade off is one needs to add more Omega cement.


#### Quartz Polished Discs for sample mounting and rockmag

Item # 7500-01, Quartz Polished Discs 1" x 1/16" #7500-01
https://gm-quartz.com/products/quartz-polished-plates
They are $6.60 each

*Rationale:*
We will mount <1" diameter samples on these quartz disks which are otherwise too small for our magnetometer's 1" sample holder.  This way, we can run necessary rock magnetic characterization experiments on small samples which are essential for achieving the goals of the project associated with this fund.

#### GLASS SAMPLE RODS

Part Number: 59985K91;
Manufacturer Name: McMaster-Carr;
Price: $3.14/ea

*Rationale:* Parts suggested by Isaac Hilburn for replacing the turning motor coupler on the magnetometer (as an alternative to the regular replacement coupler).
