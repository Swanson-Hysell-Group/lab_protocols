# Standard Operating Procedure
**Date:** 06/11/2020 (updated 08/13/2020)

**SOP Title:** COVID-19 re-opening lab usage and cleaning  
**Principle Investigator:** Nicholas Swanson-Hysell  
**Room and Building:** McCone 349, 351, 353 and 408 

## 1. Lab scheduling

McCone 349, 351, 353 and 408 each have an occupancy limit of one person. Usage of these rooms requires scheduling using the lab Google calendar. The lab calendar much be reviewed prior to coming to campus. The lab calendar will be discussed and coordinated in detail during weekly group meetings.

## 2. Health screen prior to leaving home

All researchers will conduct the UC Berkeley daily health symptom screener screening prior to leaving home for campus. All researchers will complete the EHD 207 online training prior to being on campus.

## 3. Precautions in transit and on campus
These recommendations follow CDC guidelines: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html

### Face covering
All researchers will wear facial coverings while transiting to campus and while on campus, both indoors and outdoors. 

### Follow building traffic flow
All researchers will follow building-wide protocols for flow of foot traffic while in the building enroute to the lab.
 
### Hand washing
All researchers will wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after transit to campus and frequently through the day. To limit bathroom usage, in the McCone 408 lab where soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol will be used. In using the hand santizer, all surfaces of your hands will be covered and hands rubbed together until they feel dry. Researchers will avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

### Knock and text before entry
In addition to reviewing the lab calender, researchers will text the active lab user list prior to entry and physically knock on the door in order to avoid contact and maintain the density limit.

## 4. Solo lab usage

Routine lab usage in McCone 351, 353 and McCone 408 can be preformed by anyone who has been previously trained. Given that routine magnetometer analysis is non-hazardous, solo unmonitored labwork is allowed. 

The exception to this routine solo usage is in the case of a sample rod breaking. If the glass sample rod breaks, use the lab contacts to initiate an video call with the PI or another lab member trained in the rod replacement SOP. Only a lab member previously trained hands-on in the rod changing SOP can preform a rod change and only when they are wearing the necessary PPE (safery glasses and gloves). In addition, they should be on a video call with someone else when the rod is changed for consulation and safety. The protocols will be followed when doing liquid soaks of paleomagnetic specimens.

## 5. Clean and disinfect

This clean and disinfect plan has been developed in consultation with these federal government recommendations:

### Clean all surfaces with soap and water

### Disinfect all surfaces and touched objects using an EPA-approved disinfectant 
(see list here: https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19)

• tables,
• doorknobs
• light switches
• countertops
• handles
• desks
• keyboards

### Additional shared keyboard protocol

There is one shared computer that needs to be used for magnetometer control. Computer keyboards are difficult to clean. This shared computers will have signs posted instructing proper hand hygiene using hand santizer before and after using them to minimize disease transmission. In addition, disposable gloves will be used when using the keyboard
