# Standard Operating Procedures
**Date:** 08/22/2017

**SOP Title:** Dual Blade Rock Saw  
**Principle Investigator:** Nicholas Swanson-Hysell  
**Room and Building:** McCone 353  
**Lab Phone Number:** (319) 325-5048

## 1. Process
#### Prior to use:
1. Equip the required Personal Protective Equipment (see below)
2. Fill water reservoir until water level is just above the bottom of the blades
3. Make sure saw is plugged into outlet. Power on the saw using the yellow GFCI—the LED light will turn on.
4. Insert rock core and clamp tightly into holder; place holder onto guide rails
5. Close the splash guard
6. Use the peddle to operate the saw; gently push sample holder along guide rails to cut the rock core

#### During use:
1. To avoid overheating, make sure that the water level is maintained (might require multiple refills)

#### After use (WATER MUST BE DRAINED AFTER EVERY USE!!!):
1. Power off the saw and unplug from outlet
2. Open splash guard and remove the sample holder
3. Place an empty paint bucket in the sink next to the saw and position the bucket and saw for draining the saw’s reservoir
4. Unscrew the stopper on the right side of saw so that water begins to drain
5. Drain the reservoir so that the water level no longer contacts the blades (if necessary, gently tilt the saw to continue draining)
6. Reinsert/screw in the stopper
7. See Waste Disposal below

## 2. Potential Hazards
Make sure to wear appropriate PPE (see below) and clothing so that the saw blades are unobstructed. The diamond blades will not cut skin but can cut through fingernails and can potentially get snagged on clothing, hair, etc.

## 3. Approvals Required
Prior to operating the saw, you must receive in-person training from a member of the Swanson-Hysell Group. Use of this lab requires the permission of Nicholas Swanson-Hysell (PI).

## 4. Designated Area
Countertop near sink in McCone 353

## 5. Personal Protective Equipment
* Safety goggles
* Hearing protection
* Apron

## 6. Waste Disposal
1. Allow the grit to settle for a few days until water is no longer turbid
2. Decant the bucket (empty the clear water only—be careful not to empty grit into sink)
3. Wait for leftover grit in bucket to dry out, then empty into garbage

## Maintenance
Please keep the saw and the surrounding area clean. Wipe down with sponge or paper towels after every use. You can cycle warm water through the reservoir to clean it, placing a bucket in the sink to catch waste. Notify the PI or lab safety coordinator if the interior of the saw requires more rigorous cleaning (requiring disassembly) or if one of the blades needs replaced.
