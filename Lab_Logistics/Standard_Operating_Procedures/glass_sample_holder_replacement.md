# Standard Operating Procedures
**Date:** 02/05/2018

**SOP Title:** Replacement of glass rod (sample holder) on Hargraves magnetometer
**Principle Investigator:** Nicholas Swanson-Hysell  
**Room and Building:** McCone 408  
**Lab Phone Number:** (319) 325-5048

## 1. Process
### Preparing a new rod (**refer to SOP for Strong Acids for necessary PPE**)
1. Soak new rod in HCl acid within a graduated cylinder in McCone 353 hood for 30 minutes or longer. **Refer to SOP for Strong Acids.** Keep track of which 
end of the rod is acid cleaned (this end will be going into magnetometer measurement region with the sample) 
and which end is not (label this as TOP with sharpie).
2. Soak/rinse the acid-washed rod end in water (within a separate graduated cylinder). Discard and replace water and repeat.
3. Take rod to a nearby sink and thoroughly rinse the whole rod, both inside and outside. Careful to not erase your TOP label.
4. Dry as much as you can with Kim wipe; let air dry complete before bring the rod into the shielded room in the Paleomagnetism Lab (McCone 408).
### Removing the old rod
5. Put on Kevlar gloves and safety goggles.
6. Make sure the up/down motors for the magnetometer are shut off (box outside of shielded room).
7. Use a sharpie to mark the old rod at its topmost exposure, just below the black fastener with the red stripe.
7. Unscrew the black fastener at the top of the old rod and rest it gently on the glass plate below. 
8. Carefully (but firmly) begin turning the glass rod while pulling down very gently. Go slowly—the rod will eventually pull out of the holder.
9. With the old rod loose, pull it up through the glass plate up into the ceiling until you are able to manuever it out of the magnetometer.
### Installing the new rod
10. Carefully align the old and new rods. Copy the sharpie mark (from step 7) at the same exact level near the top of the new rod. Be as precise as you can
–this will ensure that height levels recognized by the system remain the same.
10. Make sure you are still wearing Kevlar gloves and safety goggles.
11. Lubricate the top of the rod with ?---? (silicone WD40 lubricant outside of shielded room?)
11. Position the new rod in the same manner (but reversed) as you removed the old rod, so that its end is through the glass plate.
12. Gently insert the lubricated top of the rod into the holding mechanism. Gently push the rod upward until at the desired level. It often helps to keep the rod rotating as you wedge it into place.
13. Screw the black fastener back into place. The sharpie mark should barely be visible at the top of the rod, just as it was on the old one you marked.

## 2. Potential Hazards
Glass rods are strong but can break with too much force, exposing sharp glass that will cut easily. **Always wear the PPE listed on this document. Long sleeve shirts and pants are also preferable
–the thicker the better.**

## 3. Approvals Required
You must receive in-person training from a member of the Swanson-Hysell Group before conducting this procedure. Use of this lab requires the permission of Nicholas Swanson-Hysell (PI).

## 4. Designated Area
Hood in McCone 353; shielded room in McCone 408

## 5. Personal Protective Equipment
* Safety goggles
* Kevlar gloves

## 6. Waste Disposal
Clean up any broken glass from the old rod if necessary. Make sure any sharp pieces or ends of the rod are wrapped thoroughly with paper. Bring the old glass rod to McCone 353 and store it in the back of the hood with the others.
