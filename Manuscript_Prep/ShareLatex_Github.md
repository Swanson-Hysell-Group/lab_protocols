If you want to make changes on your local computer (e.g. for figures) while working on a ShareLatex document here is the preferred protocol to avoid a mess of git conflicts:

1) commit and push changes made in sharelatex
2) pull changes on your local computer
3) make changes on your local computer
4) commit and push changes made on your local computer
5) pull changes into sharelatex
6) continue working in sharelatex
