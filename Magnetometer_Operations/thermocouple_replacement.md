# Instructions on replacing the thermocouple (outer zone) for ASC TD48 thermal demagnetizer

1. Slide the thermocouple into the hole in the oven. Be careful not to allow the delicate leads to catch as you are inserting it. If necessary, clear the hole with a 3 mm rod before inserting the thermocouple
2. Secure the thermocouple connector to the case of the oven using the screw provided.
3. Orient the oven upside-down (thermocouple entry holes directly on the bottom), and block it on both sides so that it does not roll on the table. Wedge a small screwdriver below the sheath of the thermocouple near the entry hole, so that it presses the thermocouple tightly into the hole.
4. Using a flashlight, examine the area inside the oven where the thermocouple protrudes through the inner wall of the oven. You should see a slight depression (furrow) to one side of the entry point which is oriented parallel to the windings (you may need a dental mirror to see it). Using the slotted tool provided, bend the thermocouple in the direction of the depression. Using a long screwdriver, press the thermocouple into the depression so that it does not rotrude into the oven cavity. 
5. Turn the oven right side up and secure the thermocouple to the oven case by applying a glob of silicone rubber cement around the entry hole. Allow the cement to cure before using the oven. 
6. Call Craig at 401-792-3537 if you have any questions. 
7. The recommended brand for the silicone rubber cement is GE. You may be able to get a 2.8 Oz 100% cement/caulk from a hardware store.
