# Paleointensity zero-field Step Directions:

1. **Check previous measurements in database and make sure no samples need to be rerun.**
   Dropbox->Hargraves->File name (ex. MCRPINT)->sample name (ex. S114)->sample name.sam (S114.sam)

2. **If unsure, Variac the oven**
   a. Check to make sure NO SAMPLES IN OVEN!!!
   
   b. Make sure Variac placed away from any samples!!
   
   c. Plug in red and black banana cables to oven
   
   d. Plug into outlet
   
   e. Turn on

   f. Slowly move dial up to arrow and back multiple times
   
   g. Turn off
   
   h. Unplug from outlet
   
   i. Take out banana cables
   
3. **Place samples in boat per set placement diagram**
   a. Make sure not touching
   
   b. Make sure they are in order

   c. Make sure approximately evenly spaced
   
4. **Put samples in oven**
5. **Plug in thermocouple**
6. **Turn oven on**
   a. Flip power switch on
   
   b. Turn timer dial to really high number, then press start button (Fan should turn off)
   
   c. Use black dial to set T to ~10ºC below desired T
   
   d. Turn oven switch on
   
   e. When T hits T 10ºC below set point, turn up T-dial (black dial) to set point
   
   f. When T hits set point, wait allotted soak time (e.g. 20 minutes)
   
   g. After allotted soak time, turn timer dial to 0 (fan should turn on), and turn oven switch off
   
   h. Wait allotted until samples have cooled below set cool T (e.g. 30ºC)
   
7. **Turn oven off**
   a. Turn power switch off
   
   b. Unplug thermocouple and take samples out
