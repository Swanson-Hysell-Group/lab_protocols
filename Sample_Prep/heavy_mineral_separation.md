# Heavy mineral separation

If it is a good zircon bearing rock you can stay away from the jaw crusher and disc mill and get plenty of zircons from a couple fist-sized pieces that are easier to crush in a shatter box.

## Shatterbox
Pulse the rock in a shatter box. Turning it on for 5 seconds, then off. Sieve at 500um. Repeat.

Clean the shatter box vigorously and extensively between samples. Contamination is the enemy!!

## Rinse the rock flour
The rock flour can be rinsed to remove light fines. Heavies can be concentrated through panning. See panning tips here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CfxcLM2cuw

## Use the Frantz for magnetic separation

If you are only interested in zircon (not rutile, etc.), pass the material through the Frantz magnetic separator at 1.4 amps.

## Heavy liquids

The non-magnetic fraction can then be separated using heavy liquids.
